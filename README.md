Urban Reapers is detailed Serial Killer simulator.



Very inspired by all tries on developing Serial Killer Rogue like we are going to use ideas and build our initial roadmap according to features that were already implemented in those. Team is pretty new to gamedev scene so you shouldn't wait for miracle, if you notice that we are doing something in obviously wrong way or if you want to contribute and help us maintain this code - you are free to open pull request or create issue. 

Game will be licensed under GPL and written in Python 3, at least for now.

We are planning on using open source libraries such as:
- [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) - a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting | Licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
- [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) - a Python library for making multimedia applications like games | Licensed under [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)
- [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) - a roguelike development library | Licensed under [BSD-3-Clause License](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt)

This list may get longer as time goes, we suggest you to mention any 3rd party libraries you use when contributing.
